# JobsDB Scraper

A few cool highlights about this scraper:

- **Lightweight,and made to run on commodity computers** - Low memory/cpu utilization due to efficient use of modern web-scraping framework (https://github.com/ulixee).
- **Avoids detection along the entire stack** - High guarantees on ability to safely scrape jobs and bypass Cloudflare.
- **Customize how many pages you want to scrape** - You can specify how many pages of jobs you want to scrape up to a maximum of all.

## Usage
### Warning: This operation is **NOT** thread-safe.

To find the maxPages available to scrape for a region (hk or th):
```shell script
node --no-warnings build/src/scrape_jobsdb maxPages <region>
```
To run the scraper (can take up to ~10m):
```shell script
node --no-warnings build/src/scrape_jobsdb [options]
Options:
  -r, --region <two_letters>  hk (Hong Kong) or th (Thailand) (required)
  -n, --numPages <number>     Number of pages to scrape (default: "all")
  -s, --saveDir <pathToDir>   Directory to store results file (optional) (default: "./jobsdb_scrape_results")
```
## Examples
Find maxPages available to scrape for Hong Kong
```shell script
node --no-warnings build/src/scrape_jobsdb maxPages hk
```
Scrape all pages in thailand
```shell script
node --no-warnings build/src/scrape_jobsdb -r th
```
The name format of the result file is jobsdb-\<region>-\<pages>-\<date>.json and saved in a folder called jobsdb_scrape_results by default.

## How it works

The server part of the program launches two @ulixee/cloud locally hosted server nodes as the engines behind page navigation and fetches, both hosting a browser with many browsing sessions.

The client program uses the ulixee framework (github.com/ulixee), where each worker (a @ulixee/hero instance connected to a respective @ulixee/cloud server node) has a browser environment and goes page by page on its page range chunk making GETS and POST fetches to the backend db. All workers have a shared page task queue. For each page, first the jobIds are parsed from the returned HTML, then for each jobId a fetch to the backend graphql API is initiated. The results are received in real time and written to a JSON file locally.
